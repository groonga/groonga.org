## Groonga 12.1.0 has been released

[Groonga 12.1.0](/docs/news.html#release-12-1-0) has been released!

How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)

### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

### Improvements

* [load](/docs/reference/commands/load.html) Added support for slow log output of `load`.

  This feature is for Groonga's performance tuning.
  For example, you can use this feature to detect records that are taking time longer than average when `load` is slow.

  Slow log output would be enabled with specifying `GRN SLOWLOG THRESHOLD` as the Environment variable.

  Here is about specifying `GRN_SLOW_LOG_THRESHOLD`.

  * `GRN_SLOW_LOG_THRESHOLD` requires specifying time in seconds as a threshold. The time of the threshold can shorter than a second with specifying decimal number.
  * A log with debug level would be output if the processing time takes longer than specifyed time with `GRN_SLOW_LOG_THRESHOLD`.

  Setting for log level would be controled with [log-level](/docs/reference/executables/groonga.html#cmdoption-groonga-l) or [log_level](/docs/reference/commands/log_level.html).

  What value to specify `GRN_SLOW_LOG_THRESHOLD` would depend on its environment and checking purpose.
  For an example, we can use following setting to check which records are taking longer time for `load`.
  For this, we specify the value based on necesarry time per 1 record caliculated with  total number and time of `load`.

  Necessary time to process `load` would be checked in [query-log](/docs/reference/log.html#query-log).

  ```
  2022-11-16 16:41:27.139000|000000CE63AFF640|>load --table Memo
  2022-11-16 16:43:40.841000|000000CE63AFF640|:000133702000000 load(100000): [0][0][100000]
  2022-11-16 16:43:40.842000|000000CE63AFF640|:000133703000000 send(46)
  2022-11-16 16:43:40.842000|000000CE63AFF640|<000133703000000 rc=0
  ```

  In this example, the time would be as following;

  * Number of records: 100000
  * Time to process: 2 minutes 13 seconds = 133 seconds ( Based on Time stamp for beginning `load` : 16:43:27 and time stamp for end of `load` ( `rc=0` ): 16:43:40 )
  * Time to process 1 record:  0.00133 seconds (133 divided with 100000)

  Therefore, we specify `0.00133` as a threshold in `GRN_SLOW_LOG_THRESHOLD` to check which records are taking longer time for `load`.

  Note: Enabling slow log may cause following bad effects.

  *  Performance degradation
  *  Larger log size
  
  Thus, the slow log is recommended to be enabled only necessary occasion.
  
* [API](/docs/reference/api.html) Added new API `grn_is_reference_count_enable()`.
  
  This new API would return boolean weather reference count mode is enabled or not.

* [API](/docs/reference/api.html) Added new API `grn_set_reference_count_enable(bool enable)`.

  This new API would enable or disable reference count mode. 

  For secure usage,  this API can't switch reference count mode if there are multiple open database. 

* [API](/docs/reference/api.html) Added new API  `grn_is_back_trace_enable()`.
  
  This new API would return boolean weather logging back trace is enabled or not.

* [API](/docs/reference/api.html) Added new API `grn_set_back_trace_enable(bool enable)`.

  This new API would enable or disable logging back trace. 

  In some environments, Groonga crashes when logging back trace, 
  logging back trace should be disabled in such envoronments.

* [status](/docs/reference/commands/status.html) Added new items: `back_trace` and `reference_count`.

  `reference_count` indicates weather logging back trace is enabled or not as boolean.

  `back_trace` indicates weather logging back trace is enabled or not as boolean.

  ```

    {

      "back_trace": true,
      "reference_count": false,
    }
  ]
  ```

### Fixes

* [select](/docs/reference/commands/select) [Vector column](/docs/reference/columns/vector) Fixed a bug displaying integer in the results when a weight vector column specifies `WEIGHT FLOAT32`.

  This bug was only appeared in use of a weight vector column without reference type. A reference type weight vector column does not have this bug.

  The bug only affected on the final result display even though internal processes was in floating-point number.

  An example for this bug as follows;

  ```
  table_create Memos TABLE_HASH_KEY ShortText
  # [[0,0.0,0.0],true]
  column_create Memos tags COLUMN_VECTOR|WITH_WEIGHT|WEIGHT_FLOAT32 ShortText
  # [[0,0.0,0.0],true]
  load --table Memos
  [
  {
    "_key": "Groonga is fast",
    "tags": {
      "groonga": 2.8,
      "full text search": 1.2
    }
  }
  ]
  # [[0,0.0,0.0],1]
  select Memos
  # [
  #   [
  #     0,
  #     0.0,
  #     0.0
  #   ],
  #   [
  #     [
  #       [
  #         1
  #       ],
  #       [
  #         [
  #           "_id",
  #           "UInt32"
  #         ],
  #         [
  #           "_key",
  #           "ShortText"
  #         ],
  #         [
  #           "tags",
  #           "ShortText"
  #         ]
  #       ],
  #       [
  #         1,
  #         "Groonga is fast",
  #         {
  #           "groonga": 2,
  #           "full text search": 1
  #         }
  #       ]
  #     ]
  #   ]
  # ]
  ```

  `tags` column is a `ShortText` type weight vector column, sample of non-reference type weight vector column.

  The results in this sample, the value 2 and 1 are returned as below, evne though the correct value should be 2.8 and 1.2.

  ```     
  {
    "groonga": 2,
    "full text search": 1
  }
  ```

  Applying this fix, the results would be returned as follows;

  ```   
  select Memos
  # [
  #   [
  #     0,
  #     0.0,
  #     0.0
  #   ],
  #   [
  #     [
  #       [
  #         1
  #       ],
  #       [
  #         [
  #           "_id",
  #           "UInt32"
  #         ],
  #         [
  #           "_key",
  #           "ShortText"
  #         ],
  #         [
  #           "tags",
  #           "ShortText"
  #         ]
  #       ],
  #       [
  #         1,
  #         "Groonga is fast",
  #         {
  #           "groonga": 2.8,
  #           "full text search": 1.2
  #         }
  #       ]
  #     ]
  #   ]
  # ]
  ```

### Known Issues

* Currently, Groonga has a bug that there is possible that data is corrupt when we execute many additions, delete, and update data to vector column.

* `*<` and `*>` only valid when we use `query()` the right side of filter condition.
  If we specify as below, `*<` and `*>` work as `&&`.

    * `'content @ "Groonga" *< content @ "Mroonga"'`

* Groonga may not return records that should match caused by `GRN_II_CURSOR_SET_MIN_ENABLE`.

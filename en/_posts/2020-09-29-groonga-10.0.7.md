## Groonga 10.0.7 has been released

[Groonga 10.0.7](/docs/news.html#release-10-0-7) has been released!

How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)

### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

* [[highlight], [highlight_full] Added support for normalizer options.](#highlight)

* [return code](/docs/reference/command/return_code.html) Added a new return code `GRN_CONNECTION_RESET` for resetting connection.

  * it is returned when an existing connection was forcibly close by the remote host.

* Dropped Ubuntu 19.10 (Eoan Ermine).

  * Because this version has been EOL.

* [httpd] Updated bundled nginx to 1.19.2.

* [grndb](/docs/reference/executables/grndb.html) Added support for detecting duplicate keys.

  * `grndb check` is also able to detect duplicate keys since this release.
  * This check valid except a table of `TABLE_NO_KEY`.
  * If the table that was detected duplicate keys by `grndb check` has only index columns, we can recover by `grndb recover`.

* [[table_create], [column_create] Added a new option `--path`.](#path)

* [[dump] Added a new option `--dump_paths`.](#dump)

* Added a new function `string_toknize()`.

  * It tokenizes the column value that is specified in the second argument with the tokenizer that is specified in the first argument.

* [tokenizer] Added a new tokenizer `TokenDocumentVectorTFIDF` (experimental).

  * It generates automatically document vector by TF-IDF.

* [tokenizer] Added a new tokenizer `TokenDocumentVectorBM25` (experimental).

  * It generates automatically document vector by BM25.

* [[select] Added support for near search in same sentence.](#near-search)

* Fixed a bug that `load` didn't a return response when we executed it against 257 columns.

  * This bug may occur from 10.0.4 or later.
  * This bug only occur when we load data by using `[a, b, c, ...]` format.

    * If we load data by using `[{...}]`, this bug doesn't occur.

* [MessagePack] Fixed a bug that float32 value isn't be unpacked correctly.

* [Fixed the following bugs related multi column index.](#multi-column-index)

  * `_score` may be broken with full text search.
  * The records that couldn't hit might hit.

### [highlight], [highlight_full](/docs/reference/functions/highlight_full.html) Added support for normalizer options {#highlight}

* We can also specify normalizer options into `highlight()` and `highlight_full()`.
* Please refer to the following about possible options to set.

  * https://groonga.org/docs/reference/normalizers/normalizer_nfkc100.html#parameters

* For example, we can identify hyphen that has different code point by using `unify_hyphen`.

  ```
  table_create Entries TABLE_NO_KEY
  column_create Entries body COLUMN_SCALAR ShortText

  load --table Entries
  [
  {"body": "full-text-search. Use U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS"},
  {"body": "full֊text֊search. Use U+058A ARMENIAN HYPHEN"},
  {"body": "full˗text˗search. Use U+02D7 MODIFIER LETTER MINUS SIGN"}
  ]

  select Entries --output_columns \
    'highlight_full(body, \
                    "NormalizerNFKC121(\\"unify_hyphen\\", true)", \
                    true, \
                    "full-text-search", \
                    "<span class=\\"keyword1\\">", \
                    "</span>")' --output-pretty yes
  [
    [
      0,
      0.0,
      0.0
    ],
    [
      [
        [
          3
        ],
        [
          [
  	  "highlight_full",
  	  null
  	]
        ],
        [
          "<span class=\"keyword1\">full-text-search</span>. Use U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS"
        ],
        [
          "<span class=\"keyword1\">full֊text֊search</span>. Use U+058A ARMENIAN HYPHEN"
        ],
        [
          "<span class=\"keyword1\">full˗text˗search</span>. Use U+02D7 MODIFIER LETTER MINUS SIGN"
        ]
      ]
    ]
  ]
  ```

* If we don't specify `unify_hyphen` option, `{"body": "full-text-search. Use U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS"}` is only highlighted as below.

  * Because the other record different code point from the hyphen that is included the search keyword.

  ```
  select Entries --output_columns \
    'highlight_full(body, \
                    "NormalizerNFKC121()", \
                    true, \
                    "full-text-search", \
                    "<span class=\\"keyword1\\">", \
                    "</span>")'
  [
    [
      0,
      0.0,
      0.0
    ],
    [
      [
        [
	  3
	],
	[
	  [
	    "highlight_full",
	    null
	  ]
	],
	[
	  "<span class=\"keyword1\">full-text-search</span>. Use U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS"
	],
	[
	  "full֊text֊search. Use U+058A ARMENIAN HYPHEN"
	],
	[
	  "full˗text˗search. Use U+02D7 MODIFIER LETTER MINUS SIGN"
	]
      ]
    ]
  ]
  ```

### [table_create](/docs/reference/commands/table_create.html), [column_create](/docs/reference/commands/column_create.html) Added a new option `--path`. {#path}

* We can store specified a table or a column to any path using this option.

* This option is useful if we want to store a table or a column that
  we often use to fast storage (e.g. SSD) and store them that we don't often
  use to slow storage (e.g. HDD).

* We can specify both relative path and absolute path in this option.

  * If we specify relative path in this option, the path is resolved the path of `groonga` process as the origin.

* However, if we specify `--path`, the result of `dump` command includes `--path` informations.

  * Therefore, if we specify `--path`, we can't restore to host in different enviroment.
  * If we don't want include `--path` informations to a dump, we need specify `--dump_paths no` in `dump` command.

### [dump](/docs/reference/commands/dump.html) Added a new option `--dump_paths`. {#dump}

* `--dump_paths` option control whether `--path` is dumped or not.

* The default value of it is `yes`.

* If we specify `--path` when we create tables or columns and we don't want include `--path` informations to a dump, we specify `no` into `--dump_paths` when we execute `dump` command.

### [select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html) Added support for near search in same sentence. {#near-search}

* the near search can't search in the same sentence until now.

* It can search in the same sentence as below from this release.

  ```
  table_create Memos TABLE_PAT_KEY ShortText
  column_create Memos content COLUMN_SCALAR ShortText

  table_create Terms TABLE_PAT_KEY ShortText \
    --default_tokenizer TokenBigram \
    --normalizer NormalizerAuto
  column_create Terms memos_content COLUMN_INDEX|WITH_POSITION Memos content

  load --table Memos
  [
  {"_key":"alphabets1", "content": "a c d ."},
  {"_key":"alphabets2", "content": "a b c d e f ."},
  {"_key":"alphabets3", "content": "a b x c d e f ."},
  {"_key":"alphabets4", "content": "a b x x c d e f ."}
  ]

  select \
    --table Memos \
    --match_columns content \
    --query '*NP3,-1"a c .$"' \
    --output_columns _score,_key,content
  [
    [
      0,
      0.0,
      0.0
    ],
    [
      [
        [
          2
        ],
        [
          [
            "_score",
            "Int32"
          ],
          [
            "_key",
            "ShortText"
          ],
          [
            "content",
            "ShortText"
          ]
        ],
        [
          1,
          "alphabets1",
          "a c d ."
        ],
        [
          1,
          "alphabets2",
          "a b x c ."
        ]
      ]
    ]
  ]
  ```

* We use the following syntax for using near-search in the same sentence.

  * `'"NP${MAX_INTERVAL},${ADDITIONAL_LAST_INTERVAL}"'${FIRST_PHRASE},${LASR_PHRASE} ${SEPARATOR}$`

    * If we specify `-1` into ${ADDITIONAL_LAST_INTERVAL}, a record that the interval the first phrase and the last phrase less or equal than ${MAX_INTERVAL} hit.

      * In this case, however much the phrase and the separator are apart from each other, it hit.

    * If we specify an integer not smaller than `1` into ${ADDITIONAL_LAST_INTERVAL}, the record of the following conditions hit.

      * The interval of the first phrase and the last phrase less or equal than ${MAX_INTERVAL}.
      * The interval of the first phrase and the separator less or equal than ${MAX_INTERVAL}+${ADDITIONAL_LAST_INTERVAL}.

    * If we specify an integer not smaller than `0` into ${ADDITIONAL_LAST_INTERVAL}, the near-search same behavior as before.
      * The default value of ${ADDITIONAL_LAST_INTERVAL} is `０`.

  * We can specify any character in ${SEPARATOR}.

### Fixed the following bugs related multi column index. {#multi-column-index}

  * `_score` may be broken with full text search.
  * The records that couldn't hit might hit.

    * For example, if we execute the following query, this bug occur.

      ```
      select TABLE \
        --match_columns 'LEXICON.INDEX[10]' \
        --query 'XXX' \
        --output_columns _score
      ```

      * In this case, `LEXICON.INDEX[0]` - `LEXICON.INDEX[9]` were not initialized.

        * Groonga decide indexed of search target by whether the value of each sections is 0 or not.
        * Therefore, if `LEXICON.INDEX[0]` - `LEXICON.INDEX[9]` were not initialized, Groonga may choose wrong target.

          * Because the values of `LEXICON.INDEX[0]` - `LEXICON.INDEX[9]` are indefinite.

        * In addition, these values are used weight of score.

          * Therefore, the value of `_score` are also indefinite.

    * However, if we execute the following query, this bug doesn't occur. Because areaes of indefinite don't occur.

      ```
      select TABLE \
        --match_columns 'LEXICON.INDEX[0]' \
        --query 'XXX' \
        --output_columns _score
      ```

    * In other words, it occurred in the following situations.

      * If we specified section as below when there is a multi column index that has source columns `a`, `b`, and `c`.

	* We specified `a` and `c`.
	* We specified `b` and `c`.
	* We only specified `b`.
	* We only specified `c`.

      * However, It doesn't occurred in the following situations. Because areaes of indefinite don't occur in the following situations.

	* We specify by filling space from the first section as below.

	  * We specified `a`, `b`, and `c`.
	  * We specified `a` and `b`.
	  * We only specified `a`.

### Conclusion

Let's search by Groonga!

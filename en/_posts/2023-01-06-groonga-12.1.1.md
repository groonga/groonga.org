### Improvements

* [[select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html)][[POWER_SET](/docs/reference/commands/select.html#select-drilldowns-label-key-vector-expansions-power-set)] 
  Vector’s power set is now able to aggregate with the drilldowns.

  A new option `key_vector_expansion` is added to drilldowns.
  Currently, `NONE` or `POWER_SET` can be specified for `key_vector_expansion`.

  Specifying `POWER_SET` to `key_vector_expansion` allows to aggregate for power set case.
  This method of aggregation is useful to aggregate total number of individual and combination tag occurrence at once.

  Following example is to see aggregating total number of individual and combination occurrence for following 3 tags,
  `Groonga`, `Mroonga`, and `PGroonga`.

  Sample case:

  ```
  table_create PowersetDrilldownMemos TABLE_HASH_KEY ShortText
  # [[0, 1337566253.89858, 0.000355720520019531], true]
  column_create PowersetDrilldownMemos tags COLUMN_VECTOR ShortText
  # [[0, 1337566253.89858, 0.000355720520019531], true]
  load --table PowersetDrilldownMemos
  [
  {"_key": "Groonga is fast!", "tags": ["Groonga"]},
  {"_key": "Mroonga uses Groonga!", "tags": ["Groonga", "Mroonga"]},
  {"_key": "PGroonga uses Groonga!", "tags": ["Groonga", "PGroonga"]},
  {"_key": "Mroonga and PGroonga are Groonga family", "tags": ["Groonga", "Mroonga", "PGroonga"]}
  ]
  # [[0, 1337566253.89858, 0.000355720520019531], 4]

  #           1
  #         ]
  #       ]
  #     }

  ```

  This result shows following.

  |tag|number of occurrence|
  |--|--|
  |`Groonga`|4|
  |`Mroonga`|2|
  |`PGroonga`|2|
  |`Groonga` and `Mroonga`|2|
  |`Groonga` and `PGroonga`|2|
  |`Mroonga` and `PGroonga`|1|
  |`Groonga` and `Mroonga` and `PGroonga`|1|

  This feature is complex. For more information, please refer to  [POWER_SET](/docs/reference/commands/select.html#select-drilldowns-label-key-vector-expansions-power-set).

* [[select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html)] Specific element of vector column is now able to be search target.

  It allows specific elements of vector column to be search targets that specifying the specific elements to `match_columns` with index number.

  Following is a sample case.

  ```
  table_create Memos TABLE_NO_KEY
  column_create Memos contents COLUMN_VECTOR ShortText

  table_create Lexicon TABLE_PAT_KEY ShortText --default_tokenizer TokenBigram
  column_create Lexicon memo_index COLUMN_INDEX|WITH_POSITION|WITH_SECTION Memos contents
  load --table Memos
  [
  ["contents"],
  [["I like Groonga", "Use Groonga with Ruby"]],
  [["I like Ruby", "Use Groonga"]]
  ]
  select Memos \
    --match_columns "contents[1]" \
    --query Ruby \
    --output_columns "contents, _score"
  # [
  #   [
  #     0,
  #     0.0,
  #     0.0
  #   ],
  #   [
  #     [
  #       [
  #         1
  #       ],
  #       [
  #         [
  #           "contents",
  #           "ShortText"
  #         ],
  #         [
  #           "_score",
  #           "Int32"
  #         ]
  #       ],
  #       [
  #         [
  #           "I like Groonga",
  #           "Use Groonga with Ruby"
  #         ],
  #         1
  #       ]
  #     ]
  #   ]
  # ]
  ```

  `--match_columns "contents[1]"` specifies only 2nd vector elements of `contents` as the search target.
  In this sample, `["I like Groonga", "Use Groonga with Ruby"]` is shown in the results because `Ruby` is in 2nd element `Use Groonga with Ruby`.
  However, `["I like Ruby", "Use Groonga"]` is not shown in results because `Ruby` is not in 2nd element `Use Groonga`.

* [[load](/docs/reference/commands/load.html)] Added support for `YYYY-MM-DD` time format.

  `YYYY-MM-DD` is a general time format.
  Supporting this time format made `load` more useful.

  The time of the loaded value is set to `00:00:00` on the local time.

  ```
  plugin_register functions/time
  # [[0,0.0,0.0],true]
  table_create Logs TABLE_NO_KEY
  # [[0,0.0,0.0],true]
  column_create Logs created_at COLUMN_SCALAR Time
  # [[0,0.0,0.0],true]
  column_create Logs created_at_text COLUMN_SCALAR ShortText
  # [[0,0.0,0.0],true]
  load --table Logs
  [
  {"created_at": "2000-01-01", "created_at_text": "2000-01-01"}
  ]
  # [[0,0.0,0.0],1]
  select Logs --output_columns "time_format_iso8601(created_at), created_at_text"
  # [
  #   [
  #     0,
  #     0.0,
  #     0.0
  #   ],
  #   [
  #     [
  #       [
  #         1
  #       ],
  #       [
  #         [
  #           "time_format_iso8601",
  #           null
  #         ],
  #         [
  #           "created_at_text",
  #           "ShortText"
  #         ]
  #       ],
  #       [
  #         "2000-01-01T00:00:00.000000+09:00",
  #         "2000-01-01"
  #       ]
  #     ]
  #   ]
  # ]
  ```

### Fixes

* [[select](/docs/reference/commands/select.html)] Fix a bug displaying a wrong label in `drilldown` results when `command_version` is `3`.

  Following is a sample case.

  ```
  table_create Documents TABLE_NO_KEY
  column_create Documents tag1 COLUMN_SCALAR ShortText
  column_create Documents tag2 COLUMN_SCALAR ShortText
  load --table Documents
  [
  {"tag1": "1", "tag2": "2"}
  ]
  select Documents --drilldown tag1,tag2 --command_version 3
  # {
  #   "header": {
  #     "return_code": 0,
  #     "start_time": 1672123380.653039,
  #     "elapsed_time": 0.0005846023559570312
  #   },
  #   "body": {
  #     "n_hits": 1,
  #     "columns": [
  #       {
  #         "name": "_id",
  #         "type": "UInt32"
  #       },
  #       {
  #         "name": "tag1",
  #         "type": "ShortText"
  #       },
  #       {
  #         "name": "tag2",
  #         "type": "ShortText"
  #       }
  #     ],
  #     "records": [
  #       [
  #         1,
  #         "1",
  #         "2"
  #       ]
  #     ],
  #     "drilldowns": {
  #       "ctor": {
  #         "n_hits": 1,
  #         "columns": [
  #           {
  #             "name": "_key",
  #             "type": "ShortText"
  #           },
  #           {
  #             "name": "_nsubrecs",
  #             "type": "Int32"
  #           }
  #         ],
  #         "records": [
  #           [
  #             "1",
  #             1
  #           ]
  #         ]
  #       },
  #       "tag2": {
  #         "n_hits": 1,
  #         "columns": [
  #           {
  #             "name": "_key",
  #             "type": "ShortText"
  #           },
  #           {
  #             "name": "_nsubrecs",
  #             "type": "Int32"
  #           }
  #         ],
  #         "records": [
  #           [
  #             "2",
  #             1
  #           ]
  #         ]
  #       }
  #     }
  #   }
  # }
  ```

  `ctor`, displaying right after `drilldowns` as result of `select`, should be `tag1` in correct case.
  In this sample, `ctor` is shown instead of `tag1`. However, what kind of value to be shown is unknown.

* [[NormalizerTable](/docs/reference/normalizers/normalizer_table.html)] Fix a bug for Groonga to crush with specific definition setting in `NormalizerTable`.

  Following case as sample.

  ```
  table_create Normalizations TABLE_PAT_KEY ShortText --normalizer NormalizerNFKC130
  column_create Normalizations normalized COLUMN_SCALAR ShortText
  load --table Normalizations
  [
  {"_key": "Ⅰ", "normalized": "1"},
  {"_key": "Ⅱ", "normalized": "2"},
  {"_key": "Ⅲ", "normalized": "3"}
  ]
  normalize 'NormalizerTable("normalized", "Normalizations.normalized")'   "ⅡⅡ"
  ```

  This bug is reported to occur when condition meet following 1., 2., and 3..

  1. Keys are normalized in the target table.

      In this sample, it meets condition specifying `--normalizer NormalizerNFKC130` in `Normalizations`.
      Original keys, `Ⅰ` , `Ⅱ` ,and `Ⅲ`, are normalized each into `i`, `ii`, `iii` with `NormalizerNFKC130`.

  2. Same characters in the normalized key are included in the other normalized key.

      In this sample, it meets condition because normalized key `iii` includes the characters `ii` and `i`, same with other normalized keys which are original key `Ⅱ` and `Ⅰ`.

  3. Same characters of 2nd condition are used multiple times.

      In this sample, it meets condition because normalized key `iiii`, original key `ⅡⅡ` with `NormalizerNFKC130`, is considered as same with normalized key for `Ⅲ` and `Ⅰ` with `NormalizerNFKC130`.

      Normalizing `iiii` with `Normalizations` takes following steps and it meets the condition.

      * First `iii` ( applied for `Ⅲ` )

          `ii` or `i` are not used at first because [NormalizerTable](/docs/reference/normalizers/normalizer_table.html) works with the Longest-Common-Prefix search.

      * Last `i` ( applied for  `Ⅰ` )

### Known Issues

* Currently, Groonga has a bug that there is possible that data is corrupt when we execute many additions, delete, and update data to vector column.

* `*<` and `*>` only valid when we use `query()` the right side of filter condition.
  If we specify as below, `*<` and `*>` work as `&&`.

    * `'content @ "Groonga" *< content @ "Mroonga"'`

* Groonga may not return records that should match caused by `GRN_II_CURSOR_SET_MIN_ENABLE`.

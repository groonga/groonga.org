## PGroonga (fast full text search module for PostgreSQL) 2.4.3 has been released

[PGroonga](https://pgroonga.github.io/) 2.4.3 has been released! PGroonga makes PostgreSQL fast full text search for all languages.

## Highlight

### [[pgroonga_highlight_html](https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/functions/pgroonga-highlight-html.html)] Added support for the `text[]` type as `target`.

We can now specify the `text[]` type as `target` with `pgroonga_highlight_html`.
It only supported the `text` type for `target` before.

A type of a returned value is also `text[]` when we specify the `text[]` type as `target`.

```sql
SELECT pgroonga_highlight_html(
  ARRAY['one two three', NULL, 'five', 'six three'],
  ARRAY['two', 'six']);
--                                     pgroonga_highlight_html                                        
-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- {"one <span class=\"keyword\">two</span> three",NULL,five,"<span class=\"keyword\">six</span> three"}
-- (1 row)
```

  <p>The goal of Honyaku Star is to be the world’s most comprehensive free, online Japanese/English dictionary and corpus.

  <p>Honyaku Star is more than a dictionary, it is also a Japanese/English bilingual corpus. In other words, a database of parallel texts to provide context, usage, and examples of words and phrases you search for. Many words have lots of valid translation varieties, and seeing it used in various different contexts can help you understand the different meanings and pick the appropriate usage.

## Removed 1.x packages from repository

We had released groonga 3.0.3 Apr 29, 2013. At that time, we also
reorganized self hosted groonga repository.

Because groonga 1.x is the seriese of two generation ago.

We had reorganized repository by following rule:

-   version 1.x packages
-   unsupported release

By rule 1, we had removed groonga 1.x and mroonga 1.x packages from
repository. By rule 2, we had removed packages matched to following
release from repositry.

-   Fedora 15

-   Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal discontinued Oct, 2012)
